# Create a program that prints the of a number entered by the user, using a simple for loop.

#Ask the user to input a number.Use a for loop to print the multiplication table from for that number.Format each line clearly (e.g., 5 x 1 = 5).

# This reinforces:
# Looping over a fixed range (range(1, 11))
# Using the loop variable in calculations
# String formatting
# EXPECTED OUTPUT
# MULTIPLICATION TABLE MAKER
# Enter a number: 6

# Multiplication table for 6:
# 6 x 1 = 6
# 6 x 2 = 12
# 6 x 3 = 18
# 6 x 4 = 24
# 6 x 5 = 30
# 6 x 6 = 36
# 6 x 7 = 42
# 6 x 8 = 48
# 6 x 9 = 54
# 6 x 10 = 60
